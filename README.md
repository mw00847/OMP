# Understanding the Geometry and Nature of Specific Interactions in Mixtures 

# Introduction
The aim of this project is to use FTIR spectroscopy, Quantum Mechanical (QM) calculations and Machine Learning (ML) methods to understand the changing geometry of molecules in mixtures due to specific interactions. A simple starting system of water and acetone causes a shift of the carbonyl peak at around 1700cm-1 with increasing water content and hydrogen bond strength. 

In the case of the water acetone system, QM methods are used to sample geometries of water at distances of between 2-4 angstroms from acetone. This provides features including frequency data, dipole moment, reduced mass, intensity, energy, geometry, coulomb matrices to be used with ML models.  With the inclusion of experimental FTIR data of the acetone mixtures as the target, the geometry of the acetone water complex can be reverse engineered.

# Abstract


# Background
FTIR blue and red shifts, 

Dilution of acetone with either water or carbon tetrachloride shifts the carbonyl band red or blue, respectively

"The strong bathochromic shifts observed on methanol OH and acetone CO stretch IR bands are related to hydrogen bonds between these groups. Factor analysis separates the spectra into four acetone and four methanol principal factors."

"Analysis  of  IR  spectra  of  ethylene  glycol  shows  that  thereare only a few contributing bands with solidly fixed vibrationalfrequencies,  which  only  change  in  relative  intensity  whentemperature is changed. It did not show any clear evidence ofan intrinsic frequency shift indicating the gradual weakening ofhydrogen bonding interaction. Only the relative population ofspecies,  e.g.,  strongly  bonded  and  dissociated  or  much  moreweakly  bonded  groups,  seems  to  be  changing.  IR  spectra  ofacetone   in   a   mixed   solvent   of   CHCl3/CCl4with   varyingcomposition  also  show  that  intrinsic  IR  frequency  does  notshift  appreciably.  Instead,  only  the  relative  contributions  ofhighly overlapped adjacent bands are changing."
