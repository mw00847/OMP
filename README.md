# Understanding the nature of specific interactions in mixtures 


# Abstract

This work looks to understand the vibrational changes of molecules in mixtures with varying concentration. FTIR provides experimental results of mixtures that can be modelled using Quantum Mechanical methods including DFT and SAPT methods. DFT provides the representative vibration of a molecule conformation and this is then used with SAPT to determine a further breakdown of the non specific interactions.

Dilution of acetone with either water or carbon tetrachloride shifts the carbonylband red or blue, respectively

"The strong bathochromic shifts observed on methanol OH and acetone CO stretch IR bands are related to hydrogen bonds between these groups. Factor analysis separates the spectra into four acetone and four methanol principal factors."

"Analysis  of  IR  spectra  of  ethylene  glycol  shows  that  thereare only a few contributing bands with solidly fixed vibrationalfrequencies,  which  only  change  in  relative  intensity  whentemperature is changed. It did not show any clear evidence ofan intrinsic frequency shift indicating the gradual weakening ofhydrogen bonding interaction. Only the relative population ofspecies,  e.g.,  strongly  bonded  and  dissociated  or  much  moreweakly  bonded  groups,  seems  to  be  changing.  IR  spectra  ofacetone   in   a   mixed   solvent   of   CHCl3/CCl4with   varyingcomposition  also  show  that  intrinsic  IR  frequency  does  notshift  appreciably.  Instead,  only  the  relative  contributions  ofhighly overlapped adjacent bands are changing."
