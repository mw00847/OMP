#Understanding the interactions between different molecules using FTIR, PCA, SAPT and other descriptors.  


#abstract

Can specific interactions and wavenumber shifts between molecules be seen varying the concentration of each in a mixture using FTIR. Can these interactions then be calculated using QM/MM methods. What combinations of molecules does PCA pick out as interactions? are these chemically intuative? Using psi4 SAPT is there a bias that FTIR sees more favourably the exchange, electrostatic or other energy decomposition?

"The strong bathochromic shifts observed on methanol OH and acetone CO stretch IR bands are related to hydrogen bonds between these groups. Factor analysis separates the spectra into four acetone and four methanol principal factors."

"Analysis  of  IR  spectra  of  ethylene  glycol  shows  that  thereare only a few contributing bands with solidly fixed vibrationalfrequencies,  which  only  change  in  relative  intensity  whentemperature is changed. It did not show any clear evidence ofan intrinsic frequency shift indicating the gradual weakening ofhydrogen bonding interaction. Only the relative population ofspecies,  e.g.,  strongly  bonded  and  dissociated  or  much  moreweakly  bonded  groups,  seems  to  be  changing.  IR  spectra  ofacetone   in   a   mixed   solvent   of   CHCl3/CCl4with   varyingcomposition  also  show  that  intrinsic  IR  frequency  does  notshift  appreciably.  Instead,  only  the  relative  contributions  ofhighly overlapped adjacent bands are changing."
